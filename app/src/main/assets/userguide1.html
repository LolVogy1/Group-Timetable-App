<h1>Group Timetable User Guide</h1>
<p>The group timetable app functions as an individual timetabling app, while allowing
you to share timetables with other users to find times when you are all free.</p>
<p>While you can share your code with an unlimited number of users, keep in mind that
the more users you share with the less likely you are to have any free times available, so 
it is recommended to only share with a small group of users.</p>
<h2>Logging in</h2>
<p>The login screen allows you to enter a username and password, and then either sign in
or create a new account if one does not already exist. As an example use "eee" for both username
and password to login </p>

<h2>Main Menu</h2>
<p>The main menu will be the main access point for the app. It allows you to select the timetable of the day
you wish to see as well as add/import events to your timetable and share your code with others.</p>
<p>It will also display the usernames of other users that you are currently sharing with.<p>

<h3>Add an event</h3>
<p>You can enter the name of the event, select the day of the event and enter the start and end times.
Times should be between 0-23 (midnight-11pm) and for simplicity only the exact hour can be entered (e.g 
9:30 is not allowed)</p>

<h3>Share your code</h3>
<p>The app will display your own code and allow you to enter the codes of other users. You cannot
enter your own code or those that you have already entered</p>

<h3>import a timetable</h3>
<p>The app will ask for permission to read and write to storage. Granting permission will allow you 
to go to the file manager to read a text file. This should be stored in /Downloads in external storage. 
If using an emulator files can be dragged into the android device home screen from your pc</p>

<p>The structure of the text file for is as follows: <br>
Day-Event-Start-End<br>
There should only be one event per line. An example file should be provided</p>
